# Word-Guess-Game

In this simple word guess game, the user has to guess letter by letter using the keyboard. If a correct letter is picked, it will replace the underscore and get displayed. If the user makes a wrong guess, the number of tries will go down by 1 and the letter will get displayed in the wrong guesses row.
Have fun!
